# Wordle Solver
Wordle solver written in c++ (could easily be converted to c probably)

Its unreasonably effective for what it does

Currently only supports windows but you could probably write a linux_main.cpp if you wanted

You have to provide your own word list but I used [twl06](http://norvig.com/ngrams/TWL06.txt)


Copy it yourself I dont care its a wordle solver
